# Continuations4s

Low-level, platform-specific, delimited continuations, implemented for Scala 3,
with support for JVM, ScalaJS, and Scala Native. Needed to support
cross-platform, "direct style" libraries.

Implementation notes:
- Scala Native has baked-in delimited continuations support;
- ScalaJS, using the WASM backend, can use [WASM JSPI](https://v8.dev/blog/jspi);
- On the JVM the implementation blocks threads, which is cheaper to do since [Java 21's virtual threads](https://openjdk.org/jeps/444).

Extracted from the [lampepfl/gears](https://github.com/lampepfl/gears) project.

## Usage

```scala ignore
libraryDependencies += "org.funfix" %%% "continuations4s" % "0.1.0"
```

Example — this works across JVM, ScalaJS (WASM) and Scala Native (executable [Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) snippet):

```scala raw
//> using scala "3.8.1"
//> using dep "org.funfix::continuations4s::0.1.0"

import continuations4s.Continuations
import scala.concurrent.*
import scala.concurrent.duration.*
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.util.Try

type Async = Continuations.Label[Unit]

/** For semantically blocking on the result of a `Future`. */
def await[T](future: Future[T])(using Async): T = {
  val result: Try[T] = 
    Continuations.suspend[Try[T], Unit] { sus =>
      future.onComplete { value =>
        sus.resume(value)
      }
    }
  result.get
}

/** Utility for interop - can compose a `Future` via delimited continuations. */
def runToFuture[T](body: Async ?=> T): Future[T] = {
  val p = Promise[T]()
  val _ = Continuations.boundary[Unit] {
    p.complete(Try(body))
  }
  p.future
}

/** End-of-the world execution, to use in `main`. */
def runBlocking[T](body: Async ?=> T): T = {
  import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch
  var result: Option[Try[T]] = None
  val latch = new CountDownLatch(1)
  // The result of this `boundary` call can be synchronous, but it's
  // not guaranteed (platform-specific), hence the synchronization
  // needed via `CountDownLatch` here. Thankfully, the type-system
  // forces us to have `Unit` as its result, otherwise we 
  // couldn't initiate async tasks. Obviously, `runBlocking`
  // cannot be implemented on top of ScalaJS (but there we can
  // work with Future/Promise at the end-of-the-world).
  Continuations.boundary[Unit] {
    result = Some(Try(body))
    latch.countDown()
  }
  latch.await()
  result.get.get
}

@main def run() = runBlocking {
  val f1 = Future(1 + 1) // executed async
  val r1 = await(f1) // semantic blocking

  val f2 = Future(20 * 2) // executed async
  val r2 = await(f2) // semantic blocking

  val sum = r1 + r2
  println(s"Answer: $sum")
}
```

You can run it plainly, via the JVM:

```bash
scala --enable-markdown \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/funfix/continuations4s/refs/heads/main/README.md
```

And you can also execute that via Scala Native to see it in action:

```bash
scala \
  --native \
  --native-version 0.5.10 \
  --enable-markdown \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/funfix/continuations4s/refs/heads/main/README.md
```
